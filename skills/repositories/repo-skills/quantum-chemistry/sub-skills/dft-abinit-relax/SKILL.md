# dft-abinit-relax — quantum-chemistry sub-skill


# ABINIT Relax (Subskill)

## Scope

This skill prepares relaxation tasks only.

It should generate:

- relaxation-capable ABINIT input
- force/stress convergence controls
- constraint policy when relevant

It should not submit or execute jobs.

## Relax intent is mandatory

Before preparing inputs, classify intent:

- ion-only relaxation
- cell+ion relaxation
- constrained relaxation (for example slab constraints)

If intent is ambiguous, ask for clarification.

## Must provide

- structure input
- pseudopotential set choice
- optimization and convergence thresholds
- stress/cell relaxation policy when applicable

## Usually should be explicit

- fixed atom/layer constraints
- charge/spin setup
- cutoff/k-point/scf policy

## Expected output

1. relaxation-task input layout
1. explicit relaxation-policy rationale
1. settings summary and assumptions
1. unresolved choices for confirmation
1. handoff note to `dpdisp-submit` if execution is requested
