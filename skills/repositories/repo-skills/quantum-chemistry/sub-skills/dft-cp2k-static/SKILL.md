# CP2K Static (Subskill)

## Scope

This skill prepares static tasks only.

It should generate:

- CP2K input (`.inp`) for static SCF
- basis/potential mapping summary
- output/restart naming policy

It should not submit or execute jobs.

## Must provide

- structure input
- XC functional choice
- basis/potential set choice
- SCF convergence policy
- k-point or periodicity policy when relevant

## Usually should be explicit

- charge/spin setup
- cutoff/rel_cutoff/mgrid policy
- smearing/occupation policy for metallic systems

## Expected output

1. static-task input layout
1. settings summary and assumptions
1. unresolved choices for confirmation
1. handoff note to `dpdisp-submit` if execution is requested
