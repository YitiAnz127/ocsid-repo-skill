# SIESTA Static (Subskill)

## Scope

This skill prepares static tasks only.

It should generate:

- SIESTA input (for example `.fdf`)
- pseudopotential mapping summary
- output/restart naming policy

It should not submit or execute jobs.

## Must provide

- structure input
- XC functional choice
- basis quality policy
- mesh cutoff and SCF convergence policy
- k-point policy for periodic systems

## Usually should be explicit

- charge/spin setup
- mixing/iteration controls
- electronic temperature/smearing policy when relevant

## Expected output

1. static-task input layout
1. settings summary and assumptions
1. unresolved choices for confirmation
1. handoff note to `dpdisp-submit` if execution is requested
