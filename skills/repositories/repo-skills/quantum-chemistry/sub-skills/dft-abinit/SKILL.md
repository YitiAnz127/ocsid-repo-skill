# dft-abinit — quantum-chemistry sub-skill


# ABINIT Task Router

Use this skill as the top-level ABINIT orchestration layer.

## Purpose

This skill routes requests to one task-specific ABINIT subskill path:

- `dft-abinit/static`
- `dft-abinit/relax`
- `dft-abinit/md`
- `dft-abinit/electronic`

## Scope

This router skill should:

- require user-provided structure or prerequisite context
- classify request intent into one ABINIT task type
- collect minimal shared context before dispatch
- delegate detailed parameter handling to selected subskill
- enforce consistent output/handoff policy across subskills

This router skill should not:

- own detailed templates for all ABINIT tasks
- execute or submit calculations
- bypass subskill-specific guardrails

## Hard requirement

The user must provide enough starting context:

- structure input for `static` / `relax` / `md`
- prerequisite converged context for `electronic`

If prerequisites are missing, stop and ask for them.

## Routing rules

1. If user requests single-point SCF/energy: route to `dft-abinit/static`.
1. If user requests geometry optimization: route to `dft-abinit/relax`.
1. If user requests molecular dynamics: route to `dft-abinit/md`.
1. If user requests electronic analysis workflow: route to `dft-abinit/electronic`.
1. If intent is ambiguous, ask one focused clarification question before routing.

## Shared policy for all subskills

- do not invent missing pseudopotential files
- expose assumptions and unresolved scientific choices explicitly
- return handoff-ready task layout
- if execution is requested, hand off to `dpdisp-submit`

## Output from router

Provide:

1. selected subskill path
1. why it was selected
1. minimal missing inputs (if any)
1. explicit next step (invoke selected subskill)
